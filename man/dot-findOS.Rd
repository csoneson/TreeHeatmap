\title{Find descendants (or offsprings)}
\usage{
.findOS(tree, node, only.leaf = TRUE, self.include = FALSE, use.alias = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object.}

\item{node}{An internal node. It could be the node number or the node
label.}

\item{only.leaf}{A logical value, TRUE or FALSE. The default is TRUE. If
default, only the leaf nodes in the descendant nodes would be returned.}

\item{self.include}{A logical value, TRUE or FALSE. The default is FALSE. If
TRUE, the node specified in \strong{node} is included and the leaf node
itself is returned as its descendant.}

\item{use.alias}{A logical value, TRUE or FALSE. The default is FALSE, and
the node label would be used to name the output; otherwise, the alias of
node label would be used to name the output. The alias of node label is
created by adding a prefix \code{"alias_"} to the node number.}
}
\value{
A vector of nodes. The numeric value is the node number, and the
  vector name is the corresponding node label. If a node has no label, it
  would have NA as name when \code{use.alias = FALSE}, and have the alias of
  node label as name when \code{use.alias = TRUE}.
